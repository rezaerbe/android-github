## [Android Architecture Components Advanced Navigation Sample](https://github.com/android/architecture-components-samples/tree/master/NavigationAdvancedSample)

### Features

This sample showcases the behavior of a bottom navigation view following the [Principles of Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation#fixed).

- Fixed start destination
- Navigation state should be represented via a stack of destinations
- The Up button never exits your app
- Up and Back are identical within your app's task
- Deep linking and navigating to a destination should yield the same stack

Check out the [UI tests](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/NavigationAdvancedSample/app/src/androidTest/java/com/example/android/navigationadvancedsample) to learn about specific scenarios.
